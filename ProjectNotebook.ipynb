    "This program can send you email homework reminders if you specify what homework you have, when they are due, and when you want to be reminded to finish them. The time entered for due date or reminder date needs to follow the pattern in the instructions. For example, \"hr mm dd\" requires 3 numbers of length 2, and 00 06 13 translates to 00\\:00:00 06-13-current year; similarly, \"hr mi mm dd\" requires 4 numbers of length 2, and 17 46 06 11 translates to 17\\:46:00 06-11-current year. Currently, this program only supports entering hour based on a 24-hour scale (e.g. 5:00 pm should be entered as 17). To make sure the email is delivered at the time it should be delivered, you should not interrupt the program from running before the email is sent. After the email is sent, the console will print \"email sent\".\n",
